## What is XSLC?

This app allows running triggers/XS functions in live AoE2:DE custom map games (RMS/CS), on request from the app! Think of it something like [Choice Chamber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359960/Choice_Chamber/) or T90's overlords, but without the overlord needing to be in the game itself!

!!! question "Will XSLC Break My Game?"

    No. XSLC does NOT tamper with AoE2:DE to work, it creatively leverages existing map making tools in the game itself to work ([XS: Reading from/Writing to files](https://ugc.aoe2.rocks/general/xs/functions/#6-readwrite)). See [Under The Hood](./map_makers/under_the_hood.md)  for the technical details!

## Where To Next?

- ðŸ§­ [For Map-Makers](./map_makers/getting_started.md) looking to create maps for people to play using XSLC
- ðŸŽ® [For Players](./players/installation.md) looking to simply play maps created to work with XSLC
