## Windows

1. Download the exe for the latest version of the XSLC Setup from [here](https://github.com/prelusion/XSLiveCommands/releases/latest)!

    !!! question "`win-x86_64` or `win-x86`"
        Press ++win+x++ followed by ++y++ to open System Properties. Now search for "System type" under "Device Specification". If it says 64-bit processor, use `win-x86_64`, otherwise use `win-x86`

2. Install XSLC by simply double-clicking the downloaded exe from the previous step.

    !!! warning "Windows Protected Your PC"
        When trying to install the app, Windows may warn you that the app is from an "Unknown Publisher". If this happens, simply click `More Info` and then click `Run Anyway`. This is normal, the warning doesn't mean the app is malicious, just that the creators of the app are unknown. It costs real money to get an app verified for that warning to not show up, and this project is made by its creators in their free time. If you doubt the app, you can always visit our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/prelusion/XSLiveCommands) and view our source. It's FOSS ðŸ˜Š

3. Launch the app by double-clicking its newly created desktop icon after the installation finishes if it doesn't automatically. You should be greeted by a window like this:
    <figure markdown="1">
        ![landing.png](./../../imgs/landing.png){: style="height:300px;"}
    </figure>

    !!! info "Compatibility"
        XSLC only supports Steam users, the app is NOT compatible with the MS Store version of the game.

4. Head over to [Usage](./usage.md) to find out how to use the app!
